A repo for both speech recognition  and speech to text as well as vice versa conversion.
The modules used here are

This module is used to convert text to speech. If we have any documents or text to be read out , Google has open sourced this API and is available in different languages.
 
2) SpeechRecognition

pip install speechrecognition

This module is used to detect our voice and convert to text

3) PyAudio

pip install pyaudio

This module helps us to communicate our python code through the ports (mic and speaker) of the device
